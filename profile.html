        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p> Hi, my name is Htet Oo Thu. I am a student at Chiang Mai University, studying Software Engineering. <br>
            I enjoy learning about technology, especially programming, and creating things like websites or <br> 
            small apps. I love solving problems and coming up with new ideas. In my free time, I like playing <br> 
            games, watching movies, and traveling. I also enjoy working on personal projects because they help <br> 
            me improve my skills and try new things. Traveling is fun for me because I get to see new places <br> 
            and meet different people. After I graduate, I want to work as a software developer. My goal is <br> 
            to build useful and creative apps that can help people. I hope to join a good company where I can <br> 
            learn more, work on interesting projects, and grow as a person. I believe that hard work and curiosity <br> 
            are important for success, and I am excited about my future.
        </p>
